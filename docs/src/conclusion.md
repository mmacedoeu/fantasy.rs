# Conclusion

This solution provides a high scalable, low latency, low memory footprint, modularized, standardized methodology to evolve into
any problem domain requering a finite automata like in business
processes and also raw protocol integration and implementations.
It could be use to implement any TCP/IP standard protocol providing
faster or equal performance to any industry or military grade strength
of quality and throughput perfomance.

It's also energy / green friendly and can run on any mobile and IOT device. Proving to have a better transaction per watt than most solutions
out there.

It's performance under stress does not degrade even with 100% duty
with constrained memory available with deviation not more then 10% of average throughput.
